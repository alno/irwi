= Irwi

Irwi is a Ruby on Rails 3 plugin which adds wiki functionality to your application.

== Installation

Setup gemcutter as gem source:

  sudo gem install gemcutter
  gem tumble

And install irwi gem (recommended):

  sudo gem install irwi

And add to your environment.rb:

  config.gem "irwi", :source => "http://gemcutter.org"

Or in your application directory call:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/alno/irwi

== Usage

In your application directory call:

  script/generate irwi_wiki

It will generate:
* WikiPageController to serve wiki pages
* WikiPage model to represent page
* Migration to prepare database

Also it will add to your <tt>routes.rb</tt> something like:

  map.wiki_root '/wiki'

== Wiki syntax (links to other pages)

You can link pages by using

[[Some page title]]

construction in text. If linked page exists, when it will be replaced with link to this page, in other case it will be replaced with link to new page with such path/title.

== Template definition

You may create your own templates for controller actions (<tt>show</tt>, <tt>edit</tt> and <tt>history</tt>), in other case default built-in templates will be used.

== Helper definition

Following helpers are defined by default and you may replace them with you own:
* <tt>wiki_user</tt> - Renders user name or link by given user object. By default renders &lt;Unknown&gt; for <tt>nil</tt> and "User#{user.id}" for others.

== Configuration

Configuration options are acessed via <tt>Irwi.config</tt> object. Currently supported options:
* <tt>user_class_name</tt> - Name of user model class. By default - 'User'
* <tt>formatter</tt> - Formatter instance, which process wiki content before output. It should have method <tt>format</tt>, which gets a string and returns it formatted. By default instance of <tt>Irwi::Formatters::RedCloth</tt> is used (requires RedCloth gem). Other built-in formatter is <tt>Irwi::Formatters::BlueCloth</tt> (requires BlueCloth gem). Option accepts formatter instance, not class, so correct usage is:

  Irwi.config.formatter = Irwi::Formatters::BlueCloth.new

* <tt>comparator</tt> - Comparator instance, which builds and renders a set of changes between to texts. By default instance of <tt>Irwi::Comparators::DiffLcs</tt> is used (requires diff-lcs gem).

== Access control

If you want (and it's good idea) to specify which users can see or edit certain pages you should simply override following methods in your controller:
* <tt>show_allowed?</tt> - should return <tt>true</tt> when it's allowed for current user to see current page (@page).
* <tt>history_allowed?</tt> - should return <tt>true</tt> when it's allowed for user to see history of current page (@page) and compare it's versions.
* <tt>edit_allowed?</tt> - should return <tt>true</tt> when it's allowed for current user to modify current page (@page).

== Attachments

Irwi allows easy attachment integration in your wiki. There area several simple steps to add attachments to wiki pages:
* Call <tt>irwi_wiki_attachments</tt> generator. It will create WikiPageAttachment class.
* Include <tt>config.gem "paperclip"</tt> in your <tt>environment.rb</tt> or, if you prefer another library modify generated code for it.
* Append to initializer (or create a new one) something like <tt>Irwi.config.page_attachment_class_name = 'WikiPageAttachment'</tt>.
* Run <tt>rake db:migrate</tt> and start using attachments in your wiki!
